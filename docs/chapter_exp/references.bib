title="A reminder on millisecond timing accuracy and potential replication failure in computer-based 
psychology experiments: An open letter",

abstract="There is an ongoing `replication crisis' across the field of psychology in which researchers, 
funders, and members of the public are questioning the results of some scientific studies and the validity of 
the data they are based upon. However, few have considered that a growing proportion of research in modern 
psychology is conducted using a computer. Could it simply be that the hardware and software, or experiment 
generator, being used to run the experiment itself be a cause of millisecond timing error and subsequent 
replication failure? This article serves as a reminder that millisecond timing accuracy in psychology studies 
remains an important issue and that care needs to be taken to ensure that studies can be replicated on current 
computer hardware and software.",

only a small impact on traditional statistical analyses, its effects on model fit to reaction-time 
distributions remains unexplored.",
